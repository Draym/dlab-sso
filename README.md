## Branch Workflow

### Gitflow

- Standard branch iterative process：`{jira_number}/{branch_name}` -> `dev` & developer test -> `staging` & QA test -> `main`
- Fixing high-priority bugs：`hotfix/{jira_task_number}>{branch_name}` -> `staging` & QA test -> `main`

> `<BRANCH_NAME>` should be replaced with a short description of the changes on your branch.

### Branches
- `main`：Host the latest stable code. Deployment to production should be triggered by creating a new GitHub TAG.
- `staging`: Test environment branch in order to test Release branch by QA.
- `dev`: Dev environment branch in order to test Release branch by Developers.
- `{jira_number}/{branch_name}`： Release branch. Responsible for development destined to a specific release.
- `{jira_number}/{jira_task_number}_{sub_branch_name}`： SubRelease branch. Responsible for split heavy workload for multiple developers within a Release branch.
- `hotfix/{jira_task_number}_{branch_name}`: HotFix branch. Responsible for fixing issues from Main branch.

This project follows these [documented guidelines](https://github.com/Draym/git-guidelines)
